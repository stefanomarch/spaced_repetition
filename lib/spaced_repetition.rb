# Documentation for SpacedRepetition Module
# This module implements a spaced repetition algorithm that can be included in any class
# to add spaced repetition learning capabilities. Spaced repetition is a study technique
# that involves increasing the time intervals between reviews of previously learned material
# to enhance memory retention and recall speed.

  # When included in a class, this module provides methods for initializing and updating
  # objects based on spaced repetition learning principles.

  # This method initializes the spaced repetition data for an object with default or specified values.
  # @param easiness_factor [Float] the easiness factor, which controls the separation of repetition intervals.
  #                         Starting default is 2.5, and it adjusts based on recall quality in future repetitions.
  # @param interval [Integer] the interval, in days, until the next repetition should occur.
  #                           The starting default is 1, which is the minimum interval used.
  # @param repetition_number [Integer] the count of how many times an item has been reviewed.
  #                                 It begins at 0 and increments with each review session.
  # The `init_spaced_repetition` method sets up these attributes and calculates the next study date
  # by adding the interval to the current date and time. It's crucial for starting the process of
  # spaced repetition with any learning item.
